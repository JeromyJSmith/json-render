    narration:
      "Welcome to the MARPA Equity Pathway presentation for twenty twenty-six. This is your succession strategy roadmap, covering financial assessment, principal offering framework, integrated design planning, and construction partnership. Over the coming slides, we will evaluate MARPA's value and determine the optimal path forward for ownership transition. This is a confidential presentation designed to guide strategic decision-making for the future of MARPA Design Studio.",

    narration:
      "Let me walk you through our agenda. We will cover five main sections. First, Foundation and Valuation, where we explore the MARPA story, current financial health, and valuation context. Second, Path A: Solo Principal, evaluating Bodie's path to forty-nine percent ownership as sole successor. Third, Path B: Shared Leadership, distributing ownership and risk among multiple leaders. Fourth, Path C: Design-Build Expansion, exploring vertical integration with Pablo's construction team. Finally, we will compare financial outcomes and recommend a strategic direction.",

    htmlFile: "cCSvjZK6.html",
    narration:
      "We begin with Chapter One: Foundation. This section tells the MARPA story, fifty years of contemplative design excellence. Our core philosophy is simple: each threshold earned, each phase intentional. As we move through this chapter, you will understand the bedrock upon which MARPA's value is built, and why this matters for the succession decisions ahead.",

    narration:
      "MARPA Design Studio. Contemplative Landscape Architecture since nineteen seventy-four. Each threshold earned. Each phase intentional. Each stone placed with care. Founded in Boulder, Colorado, MARPA was built on a philosophy of contemplative design, a legacy established by Martin Mosko, who led this firm until his passing in twenty twenty-three. Today, that legacy continues under the leadership of Luke Sanzone, Principal and Owner. This fifty-year foundation is what makes MARPA exceptional.",

    title: "Premium Drivers - MARPA Equity Pathway",
    htmlFile: "0OCQwRCu.html",
    narration:
      "Why does MARPA command premium valuation? Three metrics tell the story. First, our win rate efficiency: ninety to ninety-five percent proposal success rate, nearly double the industry average of forty to fifty percent. Second, average project scale: five hundred to seven hundred twenty-eight thousand dollars per project, five to seven times larger than the typical firm. Third, client acquisition cost: zero dollars in marketing spend, one hundred percent referral-driven. These metrics justify premium valuation multiples. MARPA competes on excellence, not price.",

    title: "MARPA Financial Dashboard",
    htmlFile: "OocZLJxG.html",
    narration:
      "Here is MARPA's financial dashboard as of December twenty twenty-five. Trailing EBITDA stands at one point six five five million dollars, the base for all valuation calculations. Revenue target for twenty twenty-five is eleven point zero three million. EBITDA margin is sixteen point seven percent, placing us in top tier territory. Our win rate is exceptional at ninety-two to ninety-five percent versus the fifty percent industry average. The active pipeline sits at five point five million in verified meetings. These are the fundamentals that drive our valuation.",

    title: "Business Health Snapshot",
    htmlFile: "YLtzJqOd.html",
    narration:
      "Let me show you our business health snapshot. Pipeline quality is verified with a ninety-five percent close rate, scoring five out of five versus the industry average of fifty percent. Talent density shows seventy-one percent licensed staff, five of seven team members, again scoring five out of five versus the forty-five percent industry average. Acquisition cost is zero dollars, one hundred percent referral-driven, representing infinite efficiency. Organizational health shows one hundred percent of core roles filled with redundancy in place. The result: MARPA sits in the premium zone on the valuation spectrum.",
  },

    id: 8,
    title: "Understanding Valuation Multiples",
    htmlFile: "b9WmZg1B.html",
    narration:
      "Let me explain how valuation multiples work. The formula is simple: EBITDA times Multiple equals Enterprise Value. The multiple represents confidence, indicating how many years of current earnings a buyer is willing to pay upfront. EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. Using MARPA's one point six five five million dollar EBITDA, a conservative four point two eight times multiple yields seven point zero eight million. A mid-range seven point one four times yields eleven point eight two million. At premium ten point two seven times, we reach seventeen million. A higher multiple reflects lower risk, and MARPA's ninety-five percent win rate justifies premium positioning.",

    title: "MARPA Equity Pathway 2026 - Industry Valuation",
    htmlFile: "jLEyJbdn.html",
    narration:
      "How are architecture, engineering, and construction firms valued? According to Zweig Group twenty twenty-five data, commodity firms trade at three to four times EBITDA with high competition and thin margins. Standard firms achieve four to five times with some differentiation. Premium firms command five to seven times with strong brands and recurring clients. Design premium firms reach eight to ten times with exceptional performance. MARPA positions at ten point three times, well into the design premium zone. The industry median is four point two eight times, so we are significantly above average.",

    title: "Premium Drivers - MARPA Equity Pathway",
    htmlFile: "uV3CgetO.html",
    narration:
      "Four pillars justify MARPA's premium valuation. First, stability through predictable revenue. High win rates and client retention create forecasting certainty. Second, capacity through scalable operations. Seventy-one percent licensed staff density allows rapid project scaling. Third, positioning through a defensible market position. Our strong brand moat is built on fifty years of excellence. Fourth, efficiency through low acquisition cost. Zero marketing spend with a one hundred percent referral-driven model. These four pillars justify the ten point three times EBITDA multiple. We are valuing documented operational excellence, not speculating on future potential.",

    title: "Valuation Recap - Key Numbers",
    htmlFile: "Jjq9kVlp.html",
    narration:
      "Let me recap the key numbers from Chapter One. Trailing EBITDA is one point six five five million dollars, the base for all valuation multiples. The valuation range spans from seven point zero eight million to seventeen million, depending on the path chosen. Our win rate is ninety-five percent, an elite conversion rate at twice the industry standard. The current pipeline shows five point five million in strong revenue visibility. The Chapter One takeaway: MARPA is a premium-performing firm with significant value at seventeen million potential. The exact price depends on which succession path is chosen.",
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    title: "Valuation Foundation & Methods",
    htmlFile: "MR6dkXle.html",
    narration:
      "Our valuation methodology uses dual approaches for validation. We triangulate value using market multiples benchmarked against the architecture, engineering, and construction industry, combined with discounted cash flow analysis based on projected growth. Core inputs include construction growth at ten percent and maintenance growth at twenty percent annually. The discounted cash flow model calculates net present value of future cash flows over ten years. Market multiples are adjusted for MARPA's premium win rate of ninety-five percent and zero customer acquisition cost. The reconciliation of both methods confirms the seventeen million dollar anchor value, ensuring fairness for both buyer and seller.",

    title: "Chapter 02: Bodie's Solo Path",
    htmlFile: "RvVjQgGQ.html",
    narration:
      "Now we move to Chapter Two: Bodie's Solo Path. This is the single successor model, offering maximum control but also maximum exposure. The strategic focus here is complete autonomy in strategic direction. Over the next slides, we will explore what it means for Bodie to take the solo principal path and the financial implications of this choice.",
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    title: "Solo Path Summary",
    htmlFile: "gZtUpG2n.html",
    narration:
      "Here is the Solo Principal summary for Option A. In short: workable but not optimal. Maximum control comes with maximum exposure. The key concerns are highest risk concentration, no design-build upside, limited growth potential, and single point of failure risk. Before you decide, we will show you the alternatives. This path offers autonomy but requires careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.",
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    title: "Option A: Solo Principal Executive Summary",
    htmlFile: "6NJYbWDv.html",
    narration:
      "Option A places Bodie in the primary successor role with a clear path to significant minority ownership. This model prioritizes autonomy but requires maximum upfront financial exposure. The structure transfers forty-nine percent ownership over an eleven-year timeline, with Luke retaining fifty-one percent and final authority to ensure stability. The target is forty-nine percent by year eleven. Total investment is approximately eight point three million dollars. The SBA burden is one hundred percent on Bodie. Luke maintains his fifty-one percent position throughout the transition period.",
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    title: "Solo Path - Financial Structure",
    htmlFile: "T4DZpkDq.html",
    narration:
      "The Solo Path uses a two-part acquisition strategy. Phase One covers gifted equity in years one and two. This establishes an initial four point five percent stake at zero cost, demonstrating Luke's trust with immediate vesting and gift tax absorbed by Luke. Phase Two covers purchased equity from years three through eleven. Bodie systematically purchases the remaining forty-four point five percent at partnership pricing with roughly fifty percent discount, price protection capping growth at ten percent annually, and funding through cash, seller note, and potential SBA leverage. This balanced approach limits Luke's immediate tax exposure while ensuring Bodie has meaningful skin in the game through structured buy-in.",
  },
  {
    id: 17,
    title: "Solo Path - Pros vs Cons",
    htmlFile: "5fWkt66R.html",
    narration:
      "Let us evaluate the Solo Principal path with complete honesty. On the upside, you get a clear succession line with one decision-maker and no ambiguity about authority. Governance is simpler without complex voting structures or deadlock risks. And you capture the maximum ownership at forty-nine percent. However, the downside is significant. You are looking at roughly eight point three million dollars in total investment burden falling entirely on one person. That creates concentrated risk. If you cannot work, the business stops but the debt service does not. And critically, you miss the opportunity to capture high-margin construction revenue. The verdict? Achievable, but high-risk with a capped upside.",
  },
  {
    id: 18,
    title: "Bodie's Path to 49% Ownership",
    htmlFile: "UMR0Eqn4.html",
    narration:
      "Here is the eleven-year timeline for reaching forty-nine percent ownership under the Solo Principal path. In Phase One, years one and two, you receive four and a half percent as gifted equity at zero cost. This is your foundation. Then in Phase Two, spanning years three through ten, you purchase approximately two point four percent annually, funded by company distributions. That brings your cumulative ownership to twenty-four percent. Finally, by Year Eleven, you reach the forty-nine percent threshold, the maximum minority stake. One important protection built into this deal: share price increases are capped at ten percent annually, ensuring affordability even if firm value grows faster than expected.",
  },
  {
    id: 19,
    title: "Chapter 3: Shared Leadership",
    htmlFile: "qLr01GeV.html",
    narration:
      "We now enter Chapter Three: Shared Leadership. This path is about distributing investment, responsibility, and succession depth across multiple partners. The emotional anchor here is important to understand. This path feels like building a team and sharing the load. Instead of one person carrying the entire financial and operational burden, you create a more resilient ownership structure. Multiple principals mean shared risk, shared responsibility, and deeper bench strength for the firm's future. Let us explore how this model works in practice.",
  },
  {
    id: 20,
    title: "Ownership Distribution",
    htmlFile: "d6IYESRy.html",
    narration:
      "This slide shows the proposed equity split under the Shared Leadership model. Luke Sanzone retains fifty-two percent as Principal and Owner, maintaining majority control to protect firm culture and direction during the four-year transition period. Bodie Hultin holds twenty-four percent as Partner. Pablo Banuelos also holds twenty-four percent as Partner. Together, Bodie and Pablo represent forty-eight percent combined minority ownership. This structure ensures Luke can guide strategic decisions while giving both partners significant skin in the game. The equal split between Bodie and Pablo creates alignment and avoids internal competition.",
  },
  {
    id: 21,
    title: "Governance Rights by Ownership Level",
    htmlFile: "90GXV8O9.html",
    narration:
      "Understanding governance rights is crucial. At thirty-three percent or above, you gain major decision veto power, meaning you can block fundamental changes like mergers, significant debt, or dissolution. At twenty to thirty-three percent, you earn a voting board seat with direct say on strategic direction, budgets, and compensation. At ten to twenty percent, you become a board observer with access to all reports and meetings but no binding vote. Below ten percent, you participate only in profit sharing with no governance authority. The additional terms include a three to five year vesting schedule and mandatory repurchase rights ensuring control stays internal. Governance scales with commitment.",
  },
  {
    id: 22,
    title: "Multi-Principal Allocation",
    htmlFile: "iVwONzrO.html",
    narration:
      "Let us break down how the forty-eight percent principal pool is allocated. The total pool equals four hundred eighty shares. Of these, two hundred shares are gifted, split based on seniority. This reduces immediate financing needs for junior partners. The remaining two hundred ninety shares are purchased, distributed based on individual capital contribution. This ensures skin in the game. Bodie, as lead principal, receives approximately one hundred fifty shares, representing the majority of the pool while distributing remaining shares to junior partners. Why two hundred gifted shares? It balances the lower financial capacity of junior principals with the need for meaningful buy-in, keeping the deal accessible to the broader team.",
  },
  {
    id: 23,
    title: "Shared Path Summary",
    htmlFile: "RpQphGj2.html",
    narration:
      "Let me summarize the Shared Leadership path assessment. It is better than the solo path for risk-adjusted outcomes. The shared model successfully distributes financial burden and operational responsibility, creating a more resilient organization. You get a balanced risk profile, stronger team depth, and shared accountability. However, the upside is still limited compared to the Design-Build potential. While it solves the risk problem, it does not unlock the construction margin that could transform the firm's valuation ceiling. Standard margin potential means you are leaving money on the table. This path is solid, but we can do better.",
  },
  {
    id: 24,
    title: "Chapter 04: Design-Build Expansion",
    htmlFile: "reDKk8IA.html",
    narration:
      "Welcome to Chapter Four: Design-Build Expansion. This is where the real opportunity lies. The concept is simple but powerful: integrate design plus construction and build a bigger machine together. The emotional anchor for this path is significant. It feels like building a bigger machine together. Instead of handing off construction profits to third-party contractors, you capture them internally. This changes everything about the firm's economics and valuation ceiling. Let us explore how Design-Build transforms MARPA's trajectory.",
  },
  {
    id: 25,
    title: "What Is Design-Build?",
    htmlFile: "CJfKSMJH.html",
    narration:
      "Let me explain the fundamental difference between traditional and design-build models. In the traditional approach, the client contracts with MARPA for design only. We earn our design fee. Then there is a handoff gap where a separate contractor takes over construction and captures all those profits. We watch that money walk out the door. In the design-build model, the client has a single contract with MARPA plus Pablo as a unified team. We earn both the design fee and the construction margin. Delivery is faster because there is no handoff gap. The bottom line? Design-build is the only path where MARPA captures construction profits instead of handing them away.",
  },
  {
    id: 26,
    title: "Three-Way Ownership Split",
    htmlFile: "QEoyNM1G.html",
    narration:
      "The Design-Build path uses a fifty-two, twenty-four, twenty-four ownership structure. Luke Sanzone holds fifty-two percent, maintaining strategic control as majority owner. Bodie Hultin holds twenty-four percent as Principal and Design Lead. Pablo Banuelos holds twenty-four percent as Principal and Construction Lead. This structure is deliberate. Look at the math: fifty-two percent versus twenty-four plus twenty-four. Luke retains decisive majority control to guide the complex transition to Design-Build, while Bodie and Pablo hold equal, significant minority stakes as operational leaders. Each person has a clear role. Design and construction are unified under one ownership umbrella.",
  },
  {
    id: 27,
    title: "Valuation Anchor & Partner Pricing",
    htmlFile: "cal3VArq.html",
    narration:
      "Let us talk about the deal structure. The full enterprise value is seventeen million dollars at a ten point three times EBITDA multiple. But here is the key: partnership pricing offers roughly a fifty percent discount, making the effective entry valuation around eight point five million dollars, or five point one times EBITDA. What does that mean practically? A twenty-four percent stake costs approximately two million dollars, half of what it would cost at market value. That creates significant instant equity for new partners. And there is price protection: share price increases are capped at ten percent maximum annually. Why the discount? Partnership pricing recognizes that minority stakes are illiquid and incentivizes long-term commitment.",
  },
  {
    id: 28,
    title: "Pablo's Construction Division Profile",
    htmlFile: "KbFNRdLH.html",
    narration:
      "Let me introduce Pablo's construction division, which is the key to unlocking Design-Build. This is an established operational entity focused on high-end residential implementation in the Front Range. The numbers: fourteen full-time employees specialized in landscape construction. Approximately five hundred thousand dollars in owned equipment and established vendor credit lines. Over twelve years operating in the local market with stable history. The strategic fit is clear. They have proven relationships with subcontractors, immediate build capacity, and integration-ready operations. This is not a startup. This is a turnkey construction capability that matches MARPA's premium design clientele.",
  },
  {
    id: 29,
    title: "Margin Stack Comparison",
    htmlFile: "vzAGoYjp.html",
    narration:
      "This slide demonstrates the power of Design-Build economics. On the left, the design-only model: one point one million dollars in profit on a ten percent margin. Ninety percent goes to costs. On the right, the design-build model: three point five million dollars in profit on a thirty-two percent margin. That is an additional two point four million dollars in retained margin. The key insight? Integrated delivery allows MARPA to capture the construction margin that is usually handed off to third-party contractors. This is not theoretical. This is money that currently walks out the door on every project. Design-Build keeps it in-house.",
  },
  {
    id: 30,
    title: "How the Three Paths Compare",
    htmlFile: "0MOGPkKj.html",
    narration:
      "Let us compare all three paths side by side. Under Solo Principal, Bodie gets forty-nine percent ownership but carries an eight point three million dollar investment burden entirely alone. High risk, low complexity. Under Shared Principals, ownership drops to twenty-four percent but investment is shared at around five point one million. Lower risk, medium complexity. Design-Build also offers twenty-four percent but with shared investment and integration costs. The key differentiator is valuation ceiling. Solo and Shared both cap at seventeen million dollars. Design-Build pushes beyond seventeen million with ten-times-plus EBITDA multiples. The takeaway? Design-Build offers the highest valuation ceiling and lowest individual burden, but requires managing the highest complexity.",
  },

    id: 31,
    title: "Construction + Maintenance Waterfall",
    htmlFile: "h8h4TzZ8.html",
    narration:
      "This chart shows the dual growth waterfall over eleven years. Construction starts at one point two million dollars and grows at ten percent annually. Maintenance starts at half a million and grows at twenty percent annually. The compounding effect is dramatic. Total EBITDA grows from one point seven million to seven point one four million, a three hundred twenty percent increase. By Year Eleven, the projected enterprise value reaches thirty point six million dollars at a conservative four point two eight times multiple. Construction growth provides stability. Maintenance growth provides acceleration. Together, they create a powerful compounding engine that transforms the firm's long-term value.",

    id: 32,
    title: "Construction Growth — 4-Year Projection Table",
    htmlFile: "KhTsxWlv.html",
    narration:
      "Let us zoom into the construction division's four-year growth trajectory at ten percent compound annual growth. Year One starts at one point two million dollars. Year Two grows to one point three two million, adding one hundred twenty thousand. Year Three reaches one point four five million, adding one hundred thirty-two thousand. Year Four hits one point six million, adding one hundred forty-five thousand. Total revenue increase: thirty-three percent. New annual revenue: nearly four hundred thousand dollars. The key insight? Consistent ten percent compounding growth adds nearly four hundred thousand in top-line revenue without requiring major operational restructuring. Small improvements compound into significant value.",

    id: 33,
    title: "Two Levers of Value Creation",
    htmlFile: "pbzqHI8N.html",
    narration:
      "There are two simple pathways to grow enterprise value. First, unlock EBITDA by making more money through higher-margin integrated projects, optimizing utilization, and establishing project management discipline. Second, expand the multiple by being worth more, which means diluting key-person risk through succession, securing recurring maintenance revenue, and productizing intellectual property. When you multiply these levers together, the combined impact targets twenty-five million dollars in enterprise value. This formula captures everything we are trying to accomplish with the Design-Build expansion.",
  },
  {
    id: 34,
    title: "Design-Build Competitive Advantage",
    htmlFile: "93UnSg5l.html",
    narration:
      "Design-Build creates a defensible market position that goes beyond simple revenue growth. By integrating delivery, we create strategic moats that competitors cannot easily replicate. We establish barriers to entry that make it difficult for others to copy our model. Client stickiness increases because we become their single source of trust. Margin expansion follows naturally as we capture construction profit. And our premium brand positioning places us in the top tier of the market. This is not just about adding services. It is about transforming client relationships from transactional handovers into continuous partnerships built on trust.",
  },

    id: 35,
    title: "Win-Win-Win Structure",
    htmlFile: "ALuQyXyv.html",
    narration:
      "This structure creates wins for everyone involved. For Luke at fifty-two percent: strategic control is maintained, there is a clear liquidity pathway, and key-person risk is significantly reduced. For Bodie and Pablo at twenty-four percent each: they get a low-risk entry through the gifted foundation, affordable scaling options, and a clear path to Co-Principal status. For MARPA itself: leadership continuity is secured, the Design-Build transformation becomes possible, and operational excellence follows. Control stays with Luke. Incentives are aligned for all parties. And growth is powered by the Design-Build engine.",
  },

    id: 36,
    title: "Risk Distribution & Sustainability",
    htmlFile: "e0oJUIMd.html",
    narration:
      "Shared leadership is not just about dividing ownership. It is about fortifying the foundation. By spreading responsibility across multiple principals, we lower concentration risk and eliminate the single point of failure that threatens most transitions. This model strengthens our succession bench, creating operational redundancy where complementary skills cover more scenarios. The result is resilience with low concentration risk, a deep bench for succession depth, and redundancy for operational safety. Shared risk does not mean diluted upside. It means sustainable, multi-generational growth that outlasts any individual leader.",

    title: "EBITDA Impact - Bars",
    htmlFile: "V7ByOWcI.html",
    narration:
      "This chart shows why Design-Build changes everything. Based on our eleven million dollar revenue base, look at the difference. Under the design-only model at ten percent margin, we generate roughly one point one million in EBITDA. But under Design-Build at thirty-two percent margin, we generate three point five three million. That is an increase of two point four three million in annual profit, representing a twenty-two margin point improvement. Here is the key insight: this is the only path where Luke earns more than he gives up in profit share. As the slide says, it feels like building a bigger machine together.",
  },
  {
    id: 38,
    title: "Shared Path - What Changes",
    htmlFile: "wlLseyyy.html",
    narration:
      "Let me walk through what changes when we compare the Solo Path to the Shared Path. Bodie's ownership goes from forty-nine percent down to thirty to thirty-five percent. Total investment drops from roughly eight point three million to around five point one million. The SBA loan burden shifts from one hundred percent on Bodie to being shared and distributed. Control level decreases from maximum to diluted, but risk profile also shifts from maximum to distributed. The core trade-off is clear: less ownership, less risk, more team depth. Financial risk goes down while sustainability goes up. It feels like building a team and sharing the load.",

    title: "The Money Shot - Partner Distributions",
    htmlFile: "yPmWK7s0.html",
    narration:

Luke at fifty-two percent equity goes from five hundred seventy-four thousand to one point eight four million annually, a two hundred twenty percent increase adding one point two six million per year. Bodie and Pablo each at twenty-four percent equity go from two hundred sixty-five thousand to eight hundred fifty thousand annually, also a two hundred twenty percent increase adding five hundred eighty-two thousand per year each. The total annual profit increase is two point four million. Design-Build transforms the business from one point one million to three point five million annual EBITDA.

      "Let me walk through the four-year cliff structure to twenty-four percent minority ownership. Year one is the foundation: the first six percent vests after the initial cliff period, with eighteen percent remaining in lock-up. Year two is the halfway point: the second tranche unlocks, cumulative ownership reaches double digits at twelve percent. Year three is a significant milestone: at eighteen percent, the majority of equity value is unlocked with only six percent remaining. Year four achieves full partnership: the minority partner reaches the full twenty-four percent stake with all restrictions lifted and full voting and distribution rights secured. This structure ensures partners are incentivized for the long haul, aligning ownership with sustained value creation.",

It delivers four point seven million in exit value versus only two point one million in the design-only path. That is a one hundred twenty-four percent increase based on the seventeen million dollar canonical valuation. Luke's legacy is preserved through a stronger, vertically integrated company built to last twenty-plus years. For Bodie as the buyer, Design-Build or Shared are both strong options with distributed risk models. They avoid the one hundred percent SBA personal guarantee, provide lower exposure, succession depth, and meaningful ownership. The caveat: the Solo Principal Path remains viable only if Bodie has exceptionally high risk tolerance and direct access to roughly four hundred twenty thousand in liquid capital.",

However, Luke incurs gift tax exposure on the transfer value. These shares vest immediately with no claw-back provisions and build ownership without requiring capital. Purchased shares work differently. Bodie pays Fair Market Value, requires debt or cash outlay through an SBA Loan, and the equity is directly tied to the loan repayment schedule. This demonstrates meaningful skin in the game. Why use both? A balanced mix limits Luke's immediate tax exposure while ensuring Bodie has a real financial commitment to the firm's success.",

It is one hundred percent gifted with zero cash cost to partners, establishing immediate legal ownership. This creates an ownership mindset where partners move from employees to owners on day one with immediate eligibility for quarterly distributions. It is a risk-free entry allowing partners to validate the model before capital commitment. In Year Two, strategic balance is achieved at two point five percent ownership. This matches the value of Pablo's equipment contribution, roughly three hundred fifty thousand. It ensures Bodie and Pablo maintain equal stakes at four point five percent total. Luke continues to absorb the tax burden. Why gift first? It demonstrates unconditional commitment, de-risks the early decision, and aligns interests before capital requirements begin in Year Three.",

In the Shared Path, we have distributed resilience across three people with smaller loans of roughly nine hundred sixty thousand each. Risk level is distributed.
